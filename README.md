1 Implement linear and binary search algorithms, then analyze and evaluate
their time complexity



2 Implement Bubble, Selection, and Insertion sort algorithms, and analyze
their time complexity



3 Implement Quick and Merge sort algorithms, and analyze their time
complexity



4 Design and implement a menu-driven program for singly linked list
operations (create, insert, delete, reverse, concatenate), ), applying and
analyzing their functionality.



5 Design and implement a menu-driven program for circular linked list
operations (create, insert, delete, reverse, concatenate), applying and
analyzing their functionality.



6 Develop a menu-driven program that implements doubly linked list
operations (create, insert, delete, reverse, concatenate), ), applying and
analyzing their functionality.

7 Design and implement a menu-driven program to create a binary search
tree, traverse it in inorder, preorder, and postorder, search for a node, and
delete a node from the tree, demonstrating application and analysis of
tree operations.


8 Develop a program to insert and delete nodes in a graph using an
adjacency list representation, allowing for evaluation of graph structure
modifications.


9 Write a program in C to implement Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth
First Search (BFS) on a graph, analyzing the performance and outcomes
of each traversal method.
